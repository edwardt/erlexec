This project implements a C++ port program and Erlang application that gives 
light-weight Erlang processes fine-grain control over execution of OS processes.

It makes possible for an Erlang process to start, stop an OS process, send 
POSIX signals, know process IDs of the started OS process, set up a monitor 
and/or link to it. This application provides better control over OS processes 
than built-in erlang:open_port/2 command with a {spawn, Command} option, and 
performs proper OS child process cleanup when the emulator exits.
